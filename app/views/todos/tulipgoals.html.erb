				<p>Winter 2015 Goals</p>
				<br>
				CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Depth & Breadth of Understanding <br>
				Gain a further understanding of agile development and experience client driven development in the working world.<br>
				he action plan to measure the success is by taking or experiencing every possible oppourtunity that comes my way during the semester. <br>
				To measure how successful this goal was is by reflecting on how many oppourtunities I took advantage of and how much I learned about the company from beginning to end.
				<br><br>
				CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Creativity<br>
				Taken my basic knowledge of web design from my first co-op term, develop my further understanding of php and css functionality while applying my current knowledge of the coding language.<br>
				My approach is to take on tasks that has to do with webpage design and record every approach I did to accomplish the requested look.<br>
				To measure this goal, I would reflect on the before and after of each tasks and made sure I understand the steps I took to reach the final product.
				<br><br>
				PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Personal Organization/Time Management<br>
				Mature my current time management and work ethic, improving the turnaround time it takes to start and finish a task.<br>
				The approach to develop this goal is to make sure I plan out my approach to each task and make sure I stay the step has been acheived by the planned date<br>
				The measure of success on this goal is by how much time is spent on each task and if daily plans are kept in check.

				<p>Summer 2015 Goals</p>
				<br>
				COMMUNICATING - Integrative Communication<br>
				Help the new co-op students with setting up their coding environments and make the environment work with the new redesign of the website.<br>
				Setting the coding environment will be the how new employees set their laptop up. The one thing that is missing is to run several scripts which are in different folders.<br>
				To measure the completion of the goal I would create a shell script that will run the scripts in the correct order, which will create, populate database tables. Succes will be shown when the script successfuly runs and the co-ops are able to launch the website locally without any errors.
				<br><br>
				CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving<br>
				Fix and improve current unit tests to reflect on updated and improved object creations<br>
				Look into the unit test files and update them with new test plans that reflect on the new codebase.<br>
				To measure this goal, the easiest way is by the emails that are returned. If the email says that there are no more errors that show up during the unit test runs, then the goal is successful. There are currently two sections in the codebase that email errors when pushing code to production. When both sections return no errors, the goal is a success.
				<br><br>
				PERSONAL LEARNING GOAL<br>
				Improve on building files through scripts and learn to transfer files with a terminal<br>
				Work on tasks given in regards to creating files and transferring files to other servers<br>
				I haven't used a lot of file creation and file transfers within scripts. Measuring success on this goal would be the taking tasks that require file creation and transferring.
